# User Roles

Obot uses role-based access control to manage what users can do in the MCP Platform. Each role has different permissions and sees different parts of the interface.

## Available Roles

### Owner

Full platform management plus the ability to assign the Owner and Auditor roles to users.

### Admin

Full platform management: MCP Management, Chat Management, User Management, and App Preferences. Cannot assign the Owner or Auditor roles.

### Power User+

All Power User permissions plus the ability to create MCP Registries and share MCP servers with other users.

### Power User

All Basic User permissions plus publishing custom MCP servers (personal use only) and viewing Audit Logs and Usage statistics for their activity.

### Basic User

Connect to MCP servers, use Obot Chat, and create projects and threads.

### Auditor

Add-on permission that grants read-only access to sensitive data across the platform. Sensitive data (MCP request/response bodies, chat threads, and task runs) can only be viewed by users with this role. All other roles, including Owner, see only metadata for these resources. Can be combined with any other role.

\* Only for servers they deployed

\*\* Metadata only. Full request/response bodies require the Auditor role. Owners can assign Auditor to themselves, but this is an explicit action to prevent accidental exposure to sensitive data.

OBOT_SERVER_AUTH_ADMIN_EMAILS=admin@example.com,admin2@example.com
OBOT_SERVER_AUTH_OWNER_EMAILS=owner@example.com
