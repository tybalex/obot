# Chat Overview

The Chat Interface provides a web-based conversational interface where users can chat with AI agents (called Projects) to accomplish tasks, get answers, and collaborate on work. The Chat Interface makes AI agents accessible and powerful while maintaining the familiar experience of conversational interaction.

## Core Components

### Projects
Projects are a combination of connectors, prompts, and other information that can be customized for specific tasks or domains. Each project has:
- **Instructions**: Instructions define the project's behavior and personality
- **Knowledge**: Access to uploaded documents and data through RAG
- **Connectors**: Ability to use external systems and services
- **Model Configuration**: Choice of LLM providers and models
- **Sharing Settings**: Control who can access and use the project

### Threads
Threads represent individual conversations within a project. Key characteristics:
- **Isolated Context**: Each thread maintains its own conversation history
- **Shared Memory**: Important information can be remembered across threads
- **Credentials**: Each thread has its own authentication context for connectors
- **Workspace**: Threads can share files within the project workspace

### Knowledge Integration
Built-in Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) allows projects to work with your data:
- **File Upload**: Upload documents, PDFs, text files directly
- **Smart Retrieval**: Automatically finds relevant information for queries

### Connectors
Projects can interact with external systems through the Model Context Protocol. Some example functionalities include:
- **Browse the Web**: Access and analyze web content
- **Send Emails**: Draft and send email messages  
- **API Calls**: Interact with REST APIs and web services
- **File Operations**: Create, edit, and manage files in workspaces
- **Custom Tools**: Connect any MCP-compatible tool or service - including in-house tools

## User Workflows

### Basic Chat
1. Select or create a project
2. Start a new thread or continue an existing conversation
3. Chat naturally with the project
4. The project uses its knowledge and tools to help accomplish tasks

### Project Creation
1. Define the project's purpose and instructions
2. Upload relevant knowledge/documents
3. Configure available connectors
4. Set sharing permissions
5. Start chatting with your customized project

### Collaboration
1. Share projects with team members
2. Multiple users can create their own threads
3. Shared knowledge and memories benefit all users
4. Project owners can modify configuration
