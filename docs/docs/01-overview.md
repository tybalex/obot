## What is an Obot?

Obots are individual AI assistants that work with you to solve day-to-day problems and improve your productivity. Each obot can be customized for specific tasks or domains, making them versatile tools for various workflows.

### What can Obots do?

- **Work with tools**: Obots accomplish complex tasks by working with a rich set of tools, like browsers, applications, email, systems, APIs or just about anything.
- **Create content**: They are creative and will work with you to generate documents, databases, emails, images and code, and write it all to your own personal workspace.
- **Collaborate and share**: When you've created an Obot you think is useful, you can share it with anyone and they can also use it.

- **Built-in RAG** for connecting your Obots to your organization's data
