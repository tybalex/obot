# Users

The **Users** page displays all the users in your system. Users can be configured as admins by following our [configuration guide](configuration-guide). Non-admin users, referred to as "end-users" in this documentation, only have access to the chat interface available at the root of the domain where Otto8 is running. For example, if the admin interface is accessed at `https://otto8.acmecorp.com/admin`, the end-user chat interface would be available at `https://otto8.acmecorp.com/`.
