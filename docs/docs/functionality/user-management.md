# User Management

User Management provides administrators with tools to manage users, configure roles, and set up authentication. Access these features from **User Management** in the sidebar.

## Users

View and manage all users on the platform. From this page you can:

- See all registered users and their current roles
- Update individual user roles
- Monitor user activity

For details on updating roles, see [User Roles](../configuration/user-roles#managing-roles).

## User Roles

Configure the default role assigned to new users when they first log in. Choose from:

- **Basic User**: Connect to MCP servers and use Obot Chat
- **Power User**: Basic User features plus publish personal MCP servers
- **Power User Plus**: Power User features plus share MCP servers through registries
- **Admin**: Full platform management

For detailed role descriptions and permissions, see [User Roles](../configuration/user-roles).
